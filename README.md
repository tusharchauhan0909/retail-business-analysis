# Retail Business Performance \& Profitability Analysis



### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail business performance with a strong emphasis on  profitability rather than just revenue.  

The goal is to identify key drivers of profit and margin leakage across \*\*customer segments, products, cost structure, and delivery performance\*\*, and to translate SQL-based insights into actionable business recommendations.

### Business Problem

Retail businesses often experience strong sales growth but inconsistent profitability.  

This project addresses the question:



Why does revenue growth not always result in higher profit, and which business areas contribute most to profit or loss?

### Objectives

\- Evaluate overall revenue, cost, profit, and profit margin

\- Identify high-value customer segments

\- Analyze product-level sales and profitability

\- Detect margin leakage caused by cost and pricing inefficiencies

\- Assess the impact of delivery performance on profitability

\- Communicate insights through an executive dashboard

### Analysis Performed (SQL-Driven)

\- Overall business KPIs: revenue, cost, profit, profit margin

\- Customer segmentation analysis (Gold, Silver, Platinum)

\- Product-level sales performance (top \& bottom products)

\- Product profitability and margin analysis

\- Unit cost vs selling price evaluation

\- Delivery speed impact on profit



All business logic and calculations were implemented directly in SQL to ensure accuracy and traceability.

### Key Insights

\- Revenue growth alone is not a reliable indicator of business health

\- High-value customer segments contribute a disproportionately higher share of profit

\- A small subset of products drives most revenue, while some high-selling products generate low margins

\- Cost structure plays a critical role in determining product profitability

\- Faster delivery performance is associated with higher profit contribution

### Business Recommendations

\- Shift focus from revenue growth to margin optimization

\- Strengthen retention strategies for high-value customers

\- Optimize the product portfolio by prioritizing high-margin products

\- Improve cost control and supplier efficiency

\- Enhance delivery performance for profitable products and customer segments
